# yaccish
Here are a couple of examples of Yacc-influenced parser generators.

The first is Happy, a parser generator for Haskell. The source code for it 
is as similar to Yacc as possible but of course it's Haskell underneath rather than C or C++ as for Yacc.

The second is PLY, David Beazley's "Python Lex/Yacc" reimplementation. It's
not quite like Yacc in that the production rules are in the docstrings of
functions rather than in a separate section or .y file.

The PLY python excerpt is a small piece of the parser generator code I wrote
for a compiler project in graduate school at the Univerity of Washington in 
2009. It's not a legal Python program, just an excerpt.

Enjoy!
